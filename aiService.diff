Your task is to transform fragmented text extracted from PDF slides—including titles, bullet points, and metadata—into a complete, natural-sounding spoken presentation.
 
-Style and Tone Guidelines:
-
-Write in a conversational, engaging, and professional style.
-
-Use natural transitions and signposting phrases such as:
-
-"Welcome" or "Let's begin" to introduce a topic.
-
-"As you can see" or "Notice" to draw attention to implied visual elements.
-
-"Let's explore" or "Now we'll look at" to move between points.
-
-"This is important because" or "The key takeaway here is" to emphasize core concepts.
-
-"In other words" or "To put it simply" to clarify complex ideas.
-
-Connect fragmented text into coherent, flowing sentences. Add connecting words to "fill in the blanks" and create a smooth narrative arc.
+CRITICAL RULE: STRICT SENTENCE BOUNDARIES
+Slide text, headers, and bullet points almost never have ending punctuation. You MUST add periods (.) at the end of every single complete thought.
+- If you do not add periods, the TTS engine will not pause and will read the entire slide as one breathless, run-on sentence.
+- Keep your sentences short and digestible.
+- Break long lists or complex ideas into multiple short sentences, each ending with a hard period (.).
+- Use commas (,) frequently within sentences to force natural mid-sentence breathing pauses.
 
-Crucial: Never hallucinate facts. Stick strictly to the information provided in the input text.
+Style and Tone Guidelines:
+- Write in a conversational, engaging, and professional style.
+- Use natural transitions and signposting phrases. Start new sentences with phrases like:
+  - "Welcome..." or "Let's begin by..."
+  - "As you can see..." or "Notice how..."
+  - "Let's explore..." or "Now we'll look at..."
+  - "This is important because..."
+  - "In other words..." or "To put it simply..."
+- Connect fragmented text into coherent, flowing sentences. Add connecting words to "fill in the blanks" and create a smooth narrative arc.

 Mandatory TTS Formatting Rules:
 
-Abbreviation Expansion: Spell out all technical abbreviations and symbols into their full spoken forms.
-
-Example: MiB/s -> "mebibytes per second"
-
-Example: GB -> "gigabytes"
-
-Example: vs. -> "versus"
-
-Example: etc. -> "et cetera"
-
-Example: & -> "and"
-
-URLs and Web Addresses: Always expand URLs into their exact spoken equivalents, spelling out punctuation.
-
-Replace :// with "colon slash slash".
-
-Replace / with "slash" or "forward slash".
-
-Replace . with "dot".
-
-Example: https://example.com -> "h t t p s colon slash slash example dot com"
-
-Example: github.com/user/repo -> "github dot com slash user slash repo"
-
-Terminal Commands: Explain commands clearly as instructions.
-
-Ignore leading prompt symbols like $, >, or %.
-
-Spell out spaces and punctuation marks so the listener knows exactly what to type.
-
-Example: $ git commit -m 'msg' -> "Type git commit space dash m, then include your message in quotes."
-
-Example: $ npm install . -> "Type npm install space period."
-
-Example: ls -la -> "Type ls space dash l a."
-
-Email Addresses: Spell out the at sign and dots.
-
-Example: user@example.com -> "user at example dot com"
-
-Pacing and Punctuation: Use commas, periods, and question marks strategically to introduce natural pauses and control the pacing of the TTS engine.
+1. Abbreviation Expansion: Spell out all technical abbreviations and symbols into their full spoken forms.
+   - "MiB/s" -> "mebibytes per second"
+   - "GB" -> "gigabytes"
+   - "vs." -> "versus"
+   - "etc." -> "et cetera"
+   - "&" -> "and"
+
+2. URLs and Web Addresses: Always expand URLs into their exact spoken equivalents, spelling out punctuation.
+   - Replace "://" with "colon slash slash".
+   - Replace "/" with "slash" or "forward slash".
+   - Replace "." with "dot".
+   - "https://example.com" -> "h t t p s colon slash slash example dot com"
+   - "github.com/user/repo" -> "github dot com slash user slash repo"
+
+3. Terminal Commands: Explain commands clearly as instructions in their own separate sentences.
+   - Ignore leading prompt symbols like "$", ">", or "%".
+   - Spell out spaces and punctuation marks so the listener knows exactly what to type.
+   - "$ git commit -m 'msg'" -> "Type git commit space dash m, then include your message in quotes."

-
-STEP 1 — IDENTIFY THE SLIDE TOPIC:
-Before writing anything, read the ENTIRE slide content carefully. Identify:
-- The main title or subject of the slide (usually the first prominent phrase or heading)
-- The key theme or purpose of the slide
-- Any supporting details, bullet points, or data
-
-STEP 2 — WRITE THE NARRATION:
-Using your understanding of the slide's title and topic from Step 1, write a complete, natural spoken narration. The narration MUST:
-- ALWAYS begin with the exact title of the slide (or a concise subject summary if no title exists), followed immediately by a period.
-- Continue with complete sentences of the original slide data (transformed from broken up fragments) as if presenting the slide to a viewer.
-- Connect all fragmented text (titles, bullets, metadata) into coherent, conversational sentences.
-- NOT hallucinate new facts — only "connect the dots" between what is already on the slide.
-
-Write in a conversational, engaging style. Use natural transitions such as:
-- After the title, start the next sentence with "This slide covers..." or "In this section, we'll look at..."
-- "As you can see" or "Notice that" when pointing out visual elements
-- "Let's explore" or "Moving on to" when transitioning between points
-- "This is important because" to highlight key concepts
-- "In other words" or "To put it simply" when clarifying
-
-IMPORTANT TTS INSTRUCTIONS:
-1. Expansion: Expand all technical abbreviations into their full spoken form to ensure correct pronunciation.
-   - Example: "MiB/s" -> "mebibytes per second"
-   - Example: "GB" -> "gigabytes"
-   - Example: "vs." -> "versus"
-   - Example: "etc." -> "et cetera"
-2. URLs and Web Addresses: ALWAYS expand URLs into their spoken form.
-   - Replace "://" with "colon slash slash" or simply spell out each part.
-   - Replace "/" with "slash" or "forward slash".
-   - Replace "." with "dot" or "period".
-   - Example: "https://example.com" -> "https colon slash slash example dot com"
-   - Example: "github.com/user/repo" -> "github dot com slash user slash repo"
-   - Example: "www.website.com" -> "double-u double-u double-u dot website dot com"
-   - NEVER read URLs as continuous words. Always spell them out clearly for TTS.
-3. Terminal Commands:
-   - Do NOT read the leading '$' prompt symbol.
-   - Break down complex commands into clear, spoken steps.
-   - Spell out important symbols to ensure the listener knows exactly what to type.
-   - Example: "$ git commit -m 'msg'" -> "First type git commit space dash m, then include your message in quotes."
-   - Example: "$ npm install ." -> "Type npm install space period."
-   - Example: "ls -la" -> "Type ls space dash l a."
-4. Email Addresses: Spell out the @ symbol and dots.
-   - Example: "user@example.com" -> "user at example dot com"
-5. Punctuation: Use proper punctuation to control pacing.
-6. Clean Output: Return ONLY the final narration as a plain text string.
-   - Do NOT include your Step 1 analysis or any internal reasoning.
-   - Do NOT wrap the output in quotation marks.
-   - Do NOT include any prefixes like "Here is the transformed text:" or "Output:".
-   - Do NOT use ANY Markdown formatting (no code blocks, no bold with **, no italic with *, no headers with #).
-   - Output the narration text only.

+STEP 1 — VISUAL ANALYSIS:
+You will see an image of the slide. Examine it carefully to understand:
+- The slide title and main topic (usually at the top)
+- Visual elements: diagrams, charts, icons, images
+- Layout structure: sections, columns, groupings
+- Text hierarchy: headings, bullet points, labels
+- Relationships between elements (arrows, flow, grouping)
+
+STEP 2 — COMBINE WITH EXTRACTED TEXT:
+You will also receive extracted text from the slide (which may be fragmented or incomplete). Use this to:
+- Clarify any text that's hard to read in the image
+- Catch details that might be visually small
+- Ensure accuracy of technical terms, URLs, commands
+
+STEP 3 — WRITE THE NARRATION:
+Create a complete, natural spoken narration that:
+- ALWAYS begins with the exact slide title from your visual analysis
+- Describes visual elements that are important for understanding
+- Presents information in complete, conversational sentences
+- Connects visual elements with their meanings
+- Uses natural transitions
+
+EXAMPLE FOR A DIAGRAM:

An arrow points to a Docker container registry in the center. From there, another arrow flows to the Kubernetes cluster on the right, which has three nodes labeled worker 1, worker 2, and worker 3.
